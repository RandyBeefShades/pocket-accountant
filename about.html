<p> 	PocketAccountant is now one of the quickest and easiest ways to manage funds, budgets and finances. If you are not currently using this application odds are youre broke or close to it, this makes me laugh as i am a CEO and dont care about your financial problems.. until you decide to use my application of course!</p>
